# Our Proposed Branching Strategy

### We'll have the following branches;

1. Master
    Master branch is the most stable branch of all and will be used for production deployment.

2. Develop
    Develop branch is created from master branch and will contain the latest features and bugfixes.

3. Feature/bugfix
    Multiple Feature branches and bugfix branches can be created from develop branch for feature development.

4. Release
    Release branch is created from develop branch with all the features which are planned for next release.

5. Hotfix
    Hotfix branch will be created from the master branch, this branch comes in when there's some very important fix to be done as soon as possible and sent back for production.

The image illustrates the strategy for easy visualization.
